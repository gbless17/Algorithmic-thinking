ALGORITHM TO FIND THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
Start
Declare integer variables a,b,c,n,i
Initialize variable a=0, b=1, c=0 //a is first element b is second element c is next number 
Read n from user
Use a for loop with condition i=1; i<=n; i++ //initialize i to start from, 1 where i is less than or equal to n, increment i
Print a 
c=a+b
a=b, b=c //end of loop
Stop
